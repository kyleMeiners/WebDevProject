      Work History:<br>I used to build engines for the Air Force's A-10. I have also worked on the stealth systems for the F-22. I served two combat deployments overseas with the Army where I oversaw flight operations with the Shadow drone system. I was also responsible for the orchestration of airspace de-confliction with the foreign military forces in our area of operations. Prior to my most recent deployment I was a Test Engineer for Matternet, a startup company in Silicon Valley looking to integrate Unmanned Arial Technology into the medical world and our mail delivery system.<br><br><br>
      Personal Interests:<br>In my free time I like to be outdoors. I like to hike and camp and I'm always on my motorcycle if the weather is good. I'm a travel nut and have been to 14 countries. I have also recently acquired a Traeger and have been getting into smoking meat. I skydive seasonally, which is a hobby I would recommend to everyone. Right now I am one year away from graduating with a bachelors in Software Engineering from Utah Valley University and I am really enjoying the field. I can't wait to see what the future holds!<br><br>
